create a fully responsive, high-performance personal portfolio website that looks like it was designed by a top-tier design agency, with a minimalist “wabi-sabi” aesthetic and seamless dark/light mode (respect system theme but with a toggle button).

requirements:

must have perfect responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

must be fast and optimized (lazy-loading images, preloading fonts, proper seo/meta tags, semantic html).

clean, semantic, accessible markup with aria attributes and proper heading hierarchy.

file structure must be human-friendly so i can easily add new projects, certifications, or edit content without touching the main code.

example: /projects folder where each project is a separate markdown/json file or folder with its own images.

/certifications folder for certificate images that auto-appear in the certifications section.

each project must have its own expandable page (clicking on a project opens a dedicated project details page with images, description, tech used, etc.).

the design should feature generous whitespace, intentional asymmetry, high-quality typography, and subtle micro-interactions (smooth hover states, fade/slide animations under 300ms).

keep color palette minimal (neutral tones + one muted accent color) with subtle textures for depth.

components needed:

home page with name, tagline, and quick links

about section with short bio and career interests

projects grid (with per-project pages)

certifications gallery (pull images automatically from /certifications)

experience section with roles, companies, and dates

downloadable resume button (link will be provided later)

contact section with email & social links

integrate social links (github, linkedin) prominently but cleanly.

use smooth page transitions and performance-friendly animations.

code must be cleanly organized with comments explaining where to update text, images, and add new content.

make sure the final build is self-hostable on cloudflare pages with zero external dependencies beyond standard cdn fonts/icons.

no dummy lorem ipsum in final — use the following real data:

name: pranjal kumar

tagline: breaking systems and making them better

location: delhi, india

email: contact@pranjalkumar.com

github: https://github.com/euphoric-habromaniac

linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjalkumar1024/

career interest: cybersecurity

experience: ongoing internship at hitech infovision as web development & security intern

leave projects list empty for now (load from /projects)

leave certifications empty but auto-load from /certifications folder

downloadable resume button (link to be added later)

the end result should look like something that cost ₹50k+, be easy to maintain, and run blazingly fast while still looking premium.
