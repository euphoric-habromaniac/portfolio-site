  "image": "/certificates/certificate-image.jpg",
  "url": "https://verification-link.com",
  "skills": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2", "Skill 3"],
  "category": "Development",
  "description": "Optional brief description of what this certification covers"
}
```

## ‚úÖ Adding a New Certification

### Step 1: Prepare Certificate Image
1. **Screenshot Method**: Take a high-quality screenshot of your certificate
2. **Download Method**: Download the certificate image if available
3. **Scan Method**: Scan physical certificate at high resolution
4. **Edit Image**: Crop to remove unnecessary whitespace, ensure text is readable

### Step 2: Save Certificate Image
1. Save image to `client/public/certificates/`
2. Use descriptive filename (e.g., `aws-cloud-practitioner-2024.jpg`)
3. Optimize file size (keep under 2MB)

### Step 3: Create Certification File
Create `certifications/certification-name.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate",
  "issuer": "Amazon Web Services",
  "date": "2024-03-15",
  "image": "/certificates/aws-solutions-architect-associate.jpg",
  "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/verification/1234567890",
  "skills": ["Cloud Architecture", "AWS Services", "Security", "Cost Optimization", "Scalability"],
  "category": "Cloud Computing",
  "description": "Validates expertise in designing distributed systems on AWS platform with focus on security, reliability, and cost optimization."
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart development
npm run dev
```

## üèÜ Common Certification Types

```json
{
  "title": "Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate",
  "issuer": "Microsoft",

## üìö Skills Guidelines

**Best Practices for Skills Array:**
- Use 3-6 specific, relevant skills
- Match industry-standard terminology
- Order from most to least important
- Be consistent across similar certifications
- Focus on technical skills over soft skills

**Examples:**
```json
// Good - Specific and relevant
"skills": ["React", "Redux", "TypeScript", "Testing", "Performance Optimization"]

// Bad - Too generic or too many
"skills": ["Programming", "Development", "Coding", "Software", "Computer Science", "Problem Solving", "Communication"]
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Category Organization

**Recommended Categories:**
- `"Web Development"`
- `"Cloud Computing"`
- `"Cybersecurity"`
- `"Data Science"`
- `"Mobile Development"`
- `"DevOps"`
- `"Database"`
- `"UI/UX Design"`
- `"Project Management"`
- `"Programming Languages"`

## üîç Verification Best Practices

1. **Always Include Verification Links**: Even if temporary, include the official verification URL
2. **Check Link Validity**: Ensure links work and lead to legitimate verification
3. **Use Official URLs**: Link to the issuer's official verification system
4. **Keep Records**: Save verification codes/IDs for future reference

## üìÖ Date Formatting

**Always use ISO format**: `YYYY-MM-DD`
```json
// Correct
"date": "2024-03-15"

// Incorrect
"date": "March 15, 2024"
"date": "15/03/2024"
"date": "03-15-24"
```
